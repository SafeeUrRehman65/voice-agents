Clozaril,Clozapine,Atypical Antipsychotics,Each Clozaril tablet contains 25 mg or 100 mg of clozapine.,Clozaril (clozapine) is an atypical antipsychotic drug.,"Treatment-resistant schizophrenia
Clozaril is indicated in adult patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, i.e. patients with schizophrenia who are non-responsive to or intolerant of classic antipsychotics.","The dosage must be adjusted individually. For each patient the lowest effective dose should be used. In patients with a history of seizures or suffering from renal or cardiovascular disorders (note: severe renal or cardiovascular disorders are contraindications) the initial dose should be 12.5 mg given once on the first day, and dosage increase should be slow and in small increments.
  Starting therapy:
Clozaril should be started with 12.5 mg (half a 25 mg tablet) once or twice on the first day, followed by one or two 25 mg tablets on the second day. If well tolerated, the daily dose may then be increased slowly in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg in order to achieve a dose level of up to 300 mg/day within 2 to 3 weeks. Thereafter, if required, the daily dose may be further increased in increments of 50 mg to 100 mg at half-weekly or, preferably, weekly intervals.
  Therapeutic dose range:
In most patients, antipsychotic efficacy can be expected with 200 to 450 mg/day given in divided doses. Some patients may be treated with lower doses, and some patients may require doses up to 600 mg/day. The total daily dose may be divided unevenly, with the larger portion being taken at bedtime.
  Maximum dose:
To obtain full therapeutic benefit, a few patients may require larger doses, in which case judicious increments (not exceeding 100 mg) are permissible up to 900 mg/day. The possibility of increased adverse reactions (in particular seizures) occurring at doses over 450 mg/day must be borne in mind.
  Maintenance dose:
After achieving maximum therapeutic benefit, patients can be maintained effectively on lower doses. Careful downward titration is recommended to the lowest effective dose for the individual patient. Treatment should be maintained for at least 6 months. If the daily dose does not exceed 200 mg, once daily administration in the evening may be appropriate.
  Ending therapy:
In the event of planned termination of Clozaril therapy, a gradual reduction in dose over a 1- to 2- week period is recommended.
  Re-starting therapy:
In patients in whom the interval since the last dose of Clozaril exceeds 2 days, treatment should be re-initiated with 12.5 mg (half a 25 mg tablet) given once or twice on the first day.","Clozaril Tab 25 mg & 100 mg are available in blister packs of 50’s

• For the symptomatic therapy of primary biliary cirrhosis, provided there is no decompensated hepatic cirrhosis
• For the treatment of bile reflux gastritis","  Dosage for Urso capsule:
  For the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones:
The daily dosage amounts to 10 mg per kg body weight. Swallow the capsules whole with a little fluid, do not chew. Do take the capsules regularly. Gallstones generally take from 6 to 24 months to dissolve. If the gallstones have not become smaller after 12 months, do not continue treatment. The result of therapy should be mentioned by ultrasonography or X-ray every 6 months. At the follow-up examinations, a check should be made to see  whether calcification of the stones has occurred in the meantime. Should this be the case, the treatment must be ended.
  For the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC):
The daily dosage is 10-15 mg per kg body weight daily. For the first 3 months of treatment, Urso caps should be taken divided over the day. With improvement of the liver values the daily dose may be taken once daily in the evening. The use of Urso capsule in primary biliary cirrhosis may be  continued indefinitely. In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, in rare cases the clinical symptoms may worsen at the beginning of treatment, e.g.  the itching may increase. Should this occur, therapy should first be continued with Urso caps 250 mg daily, and the therapy gradually increased until the dose indicated in the respective dosage regimen is reached again.
  For the treatment of bile reflux gastritis: 
Urso caps 250 mg should normally be taken for 10-14 days. The attending physician will decide how long treatment should be continued.
Note: It is important for the result of treatment to take the capsules regularly. Liver function parameters should be monitored several times during treatment.
  For the symptomatic treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis:
The daily dose depends on bodyweight and is approx. 2 to 6 capsule (10 to 15 mg Ursodeoxycholic acid per kg bodyweight)
  Dosage for Urso Suspension:

There are no age restrictions on the use of Urso 250mg/5ml suspension
  For the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC):
The usual daily dose depends on body weight, and is approximately 14 ± 2 mg Ursodeoxycholic acid per kg of body weight. One Teaspoonful (= 5 ml oral suspension) contains 250 mg of Ursodeoxycholic acid.
For the first 3 months of treatment, Urso 250 mg/5 ml suspension should be taken divided over the day. When the liver function parameters improve, the daily dose can be administered once a day in the evening.
Urso 250 mg/5 ml suspension should be taken in accordance with the dosage regimen given above. The oral suspension must be taken regularly. The use of Urso 250 mg/5 ml suspension in primary biliary cirrhosis may be continued indefinitely. In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, in rare cases the clinical symptoms may worsen at the beginning of treatment, e.g. the itching may increase. Should this occur, therapy should first be
continued with a reduced daily dose of Urso suspension, and the dose then gradually increased (increase of the daily dose weekly) until the dose indicated in the respective dosage regimen is reached again.
  Dissolution of Gallstones: 
Approximately 10 mg of Ursodeoxycholic acid per kg of body weight daily, equivalent to:
One Teaspoonful (= 5 ml oral suspension) contains 250 mg of Ursodeoxycholic acid. Urso suspension should be taken in the evening at bedtime. The oral suspension must be taken regularly. The time required for dissolution of gallstones is likely to range from 6 to 24 months depending on stone size and composition. Follow-up cholecystograms or ultrasound investigation may be useful at 6 month intervals until the gallstones have disappeared. Treatment should be continued until 2 successive cholecystograms and/or ultrasound investigations 4-12 weeks apart have failed to demonstrate gallstones. This is because these techniques do not permit reliable visualization of stones less than 2mm in diameter. The likelihood of recurrence of gallstones after dissolution by bile acid treatment has been estimated as up to 50% at 5 years. The efficiency of Urso in treating radio-opaque or partially radio-opaque gallstones has not been tested but these are generally thought to be less soluble than radiolucent stones. Non-cholesterol stones account for 10-15% of radiolucent stones and may not be dissolved by bile acids.
  Elderly:
There is no evidenceto suggest that any alteration in the adult dose is needed but the relevant precautions should be taken into account.
Children: 
Cholesterol rich gallstones are rare in children but when they occur, dosage should be related to bodyweight.","250 mg caps 10’s,
